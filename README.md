# Smart Home Project

Welcome to the Smart Home Project repository! This project is designed to create an intelligent home automation system using IoT (Internet of Things) technologies. The system allows users to control and monitor various aspects of their home environment, such as lighting, temperature, and security, through a web-based interface. This project is implemented as a Proteus simulation, so no physical hardware is required.

## Overview

The Smart Home Project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for home automation. The system is simulated using Proteus software, allowing for a virtual representation of a smart home environment. This simulation uses the ATmega32 microcontroller to interact with various virtual sensors and actuators.

## Features

- **Lighting Control**: Manage home lighting with on/off and dimming capabilities.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Keep track of the homeâ€™s temperature and humidity levels.
- **Security System**: Monitor the status of doors and windows, and receive alerts for unauthorized access.
- **Remote Access**: Control and monitor your home from anywhere using a web browser.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to protect user data and control access.

## Proteus Simulation

The Smart Home system is simulated in Proteus, a software for electronic design automation. The simulation includes:

- **ATmega32 Microcontroller**: The central unit controlling the smart home system.
- **Virtual Sensors**: Simulated temperature, humidity, light, and motion sensors to monitor environmental conditions.
- **Virtual Actuators**: LEDs, and other output devices to control home appliances and lighting.

## Installation

To set up the Smart Home Project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdElrhmanMamdouh/Smart_Home.git
    cd Smart_Home
    ```

2. **Install Proteus**:
    Ensure you have Proteus software installed on your machine. You can download it from [Labcenter Electronics](https://www.labcenter.com/).

3. **Open the Proteus simulation**:
    In Proteus, open the simulation file located in the `Proteus` directory of this repository.

4. **Install dependencies for the web interface**:
    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Set up the server**:
    Configure your server settings in the `config.js` file.

6. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Once the server is running and the Proteus simulation is open, you can access the Smart Home interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. From the dashboard, you can control and monitor the various aspects of your smart home simulation.

## Configuration

To customize the Smart Home system, modify the configuration files located in the `config` directory. Key configuration settings include:

- **Server Settings**: `config/server.js`
- **Database Settings**: `config/database.js`
- **API Keys and Secrets**: `config/keys.js`

Ensure you keep sensitive information secure and do not expose it publicly.
